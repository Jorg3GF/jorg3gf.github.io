<p>Hi, my name is Jorge. I live in Lisbon but I call many places home. I am a curious analyst, searching for answers in data.</p>
<p>Graduated in Business Administration, raised in a family of scientists, I like to apply the scientific method to the business world. I have helped companies to make sense of their data, by combining both qualitative and quantitative sources to support the decision making process.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic about the tech sphere and the power of analytics and creativity to enrich peopleâ€™s lives. I am endlessly inspired by nature and adventures. I love waking up to new horizons and exploring the world. Also enjoy cooking and dancing. I am tired of playing chess on my mobile phone though, so if you love the game or think we can collaborate, feel free to challenge me!</p>
