An important behavioral analytics technique companies use to assess their performance is Cohort Analysis. It gives us an idea of monthly retention rates for cohorts based on customer acquisition dates, allowing us to understand clients trends, so we can make better business decisions.

I will be using a transactional dataset from an online store, which you can download from my [repository](https://github.com/Jorg3GF/projects/blob/master/CohortAnalysis_Online%20Retail.xlsx).

Please check out my analysis [here](https://jorg3gf.github.io/Projects/CohortAnalysis.html).

Enjoy!
