excerpt: "Redesigning the monetization strategy of a classifieds website"
---

I was recently asked by a popular online classifieds company to come up with a data-driven plan to better monetize their platform.

They offer a promotion feature at $5 which attracts more attention to users' ads by 7 times, as items will randomly be shown on their homepage and category page.

I was provided with a dataset containing the following information:

Column A - all categories available on the platform in which users can list/post an ad;  
Column B - for each category it is indicated how many ads were posted/listed;  
Column C - the average price users ask for their listed ads per category;  
Column D - revenue made with the promotion feature per category.  

Please feel free to access my [repository](https://github.com/Jorg3GF/projects) to get the dataset I used to tackle this challenge.

Check out my analysis [here](https://jorg3gf.github.io/Projects/Price_Optimization.html).

Enjoy!
