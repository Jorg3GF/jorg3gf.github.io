I was challenged by my mates to play the Fantasy Premier League this season. Initially, I hesitated... I haven't followed football as much as I would like to and these guys are proper *connoisseurs* of the Premier League - I didn't want to be annihilated overnight.

But well... I left London three years ago and I was missing some decent, authentic football. Why not flavouring my weekends with this exciting game?
And that's when I thought about sports analytics to fight for the title - that would be key to remain competitive against my peers! I was about to adopt the Moneyball approach... It was exactly the same use case: one has to create a team of solid players to win the league, in spite of budget constraints. So, one is encouraged to spot undervalued players and make his/her bets.

If you are not familiar with the game, take a look at the rules [here](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/help/rules). By the way, the Premier League app is one of the best apps I have ever seen. So, if football is not your cup of tea but you are a digital enthusiast, you should give it a try!

Take a look at my approach to the game [here](https://jorg3gf.github.io/Projects/fantasyPL.html) - this is an analysis of the first 8 game weeks of season 2019/20.

Hope you enjoy it!
