excerpt: "Finding Replacement Players"

Moneyball was the movie which woke me up to the power of analytics.
It tells the story of Oakland Athletics, a Baseball club with financial restrictions who saw three of their key players departing in 2001. Against all odds, they ended up finishing first in the American League West the following year, by unlocking the power of statistics to measure the performance of players who would replace the lost ones.
The new-look Athletics, despite a comparative lack of star power, surprised the baseball world by besting the 2001 team's regular season record.
Because of the team's smaller revenues, Oakland is forced to find players undervalued by the market and [this is an example of how it was accomplished](https://jorg3gf.github.io/Projects/moneyball.html).

In case you are unfamiliar with Baseball, check out [this explanatory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bKkGeROiPA).
