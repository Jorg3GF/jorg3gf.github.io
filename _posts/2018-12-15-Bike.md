Following the solid adoption of GIRA Bikes in Lisbon, I was curious about taking a look at the data behind bike rentals systems. Kaggle has a cool dataset on the subject which I felt like analysing.

Please find the dataset [here](https://github.com/Jorg3GF/Projects/blob/master/bikeshare.csv). Or take a look at my analysis [here](https://jorg3gf.github.io/projects/BikeSharing.html)
