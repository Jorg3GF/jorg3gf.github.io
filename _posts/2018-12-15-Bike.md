Following the solid adoption of GIRA Bikes in Lisbon, I was curious about exploring the data behind bike rental systems.

Kaggle has a cool dataset on the subject which I had to take a look at.

Please find the dataset [here](https://github.com/Jorg3GF/Projects/blob/master/bikeshare.csv). Or take a look at my analysis [here](https://jorg3gf.github.io/Projects/BikeSharing.html).
