excerpt: "Predicting Customer Churn in the Telco space"
---

Having started my career working at Portugal Telecom and then at International Data Corporation, I rapidly got familiar with the importance of churn rates, a key metric in the telco space. As a matter of fact, a critical variable for any service company that bills on a recurring basis.

I found out a dataset from a telco company whose rows represent clients and columns represent their attributes - you can find the dataset [here](https://github.com/Jorg3GF/projects/blob/master/Churn%20Prediction.csv).

Please check out [my attempt to predict customer churn](https://jorg3gf.github.io/Projects/ChurnPrediction.html) by analysing the dataset above.

Enjoy!
