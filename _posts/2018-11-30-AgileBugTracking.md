excerpt: "Understanding bug tracking dynamics in Jira"
---

I was recently tasked with investigating the issues system of a global enterprise software company. They use [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) to track bugs and support their agile methodology.

I was provided with two datasets which can be found in my [repo](https://github.com/Jorg3GF/projects): one of them, called *issues*, gives us info on the types of tickets created and the other, *issuesHistory*, shows us all their progress through different stages.

[My analysis](https://jorg3gf.github.io/Projects/AgileBugTracking.html) is composed of two steps. In Part I cleaned the data provided and in Part II and digged deeper into the dynamics of tickets' flow.

I would appreciate your comments and suggestions. Feel free to reach me to share your feedback!
